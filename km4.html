        <p>
          In developing this smart bone implant technology, we combined reverse-engineered design, advanced materials, and integrated sensing and communication systems to create a functional and innovative solution for orthopedic applications. Using PLA as the material, we designed the implant with precision in Creo Parametric and validated its structural integrity through static analysis in Ansys. Experimental data informed our loading conditions, while smart functionality was achieved by incorporating pressure sensors, a load cell, a wired telemetry system, a Wi-Fi module, and an Arduino Uno microcontroller. This collaborative approach ensured the integration of mechanical reliability and real-time monitoring capabilities, resulting in a patient-centric, data-driven implant ready for clinical advancement.
