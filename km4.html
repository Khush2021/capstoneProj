          Smart orthopedic implants are essential to address the limitations of traditional post-surgical monitoring methods, 
          which often rely on frequent X-rays and CT scans. These imaging techniques, while effective, expose patients to harmful 
          ionizing radiation that can damage tissues, delay healing, and increase the risk of long-term complications such as cancer, 
          especially with repeated use. Smart implants equipped with sensors enable real-time, non-invasive monitoring of parameters like 
          load, strain, and healing progress, reducing the need for frequent imaging. By providing continuous data, these implants improve 
          patient safety, minimize radiation exposure, and enhance recovery outcomes, making them a vital innovation in orthopedic care.
