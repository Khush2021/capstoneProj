        <h1>NEED IDENTIFICATION AND SURVEY</h1>
        <p>
          The need for smart bone implants arises from the limitations of traditional orthopedic treatments, which rely on frequent imaging and manual assessments to monitor healing. These methods can expose patients to harmful radiation, delay detection of complications, and lack real-time insights into recovery progress. A smart bone implant addresses these issues by integrating sensors to continuously monitor healing, providing early warnings for complications and improving patient outcomes. Taking this as a project offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of healthcare and advanced technology, contributing to a groundbreaking solution that has the potential to revolutionize orthopedic care and significantly enhance quality of life for patients.

        <P>
          After finalizing the project, we began the survey phase by meeting with experienced officials and doctors. We discussed the project's potential and how it could benefit both doctors and end users.following feedback was made
