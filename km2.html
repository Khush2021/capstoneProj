        <h1>Solution Evaluation</h1>
        <p>
          The process of considering solutions for developing smart bone implants involved evaluating key components such as sensors, power supply mechanisms, and data transmission systems to ensure functionality, reliability, and patient comfort. Three sensor options—strain gauges, pressure sensors, and biochemical sensors—were assessed based on their ability to monitor mechanical, physical, and biochemical parameters relevant to bone healing. For power supply, both battery-powered systems and inductive coupling were considered, balancing the trade-off between longevity and invasiveness. Data transmission methods included wired telemetry, offering high reliability but limited mobility, and wireless systems, which prioritized patient convenience and real-time monitoring but required robust signal reliability and security. The selection process emphasized the integration of these technologies to create a compact, efficient, and patient-friendly solution tailored to specific medical needs.
